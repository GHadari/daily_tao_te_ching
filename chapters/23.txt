24.

Keep your feet firmly planted
unless you want to fall on your face.
Learn how to pace yourself 
if you want to get anywhere.
Don't call attention to yourself 
if you want people to notice your work.

Nobody respects people 
who always have excuses.
Nobody gives credit to people 
who always take it.
People who hype themselves 
have nothing else to offer.

Think of being in touch with Tao 
like eating at a buffet:
Take only what you need.
Save some for everybody else.
