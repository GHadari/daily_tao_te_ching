2.

If something looks beautiful to you, 
something else must be ugly.
If something seems good, 
something else must seem bad.

You can't have
something without nothing.
If no job is difficult, 
then no job is easy.
Some things are up high 
because other things are down low.
You know you're listening to music 
because it doesn't sound like noise.
All that came first, 
so this must be next.

The Masters get the job done 
without moving a muscle
and get their point across 
without saying a word.

When things around them fall apart, 
they stay cool.
They don't own much, 
but they use whatever's at hand.
They do the work 
without expecting any favors.
When they're done, 
they move on to the next job.
That's why their work is so damn good.
