25.

Something perfect
has existed forever,
even longer than the universe.
It's a vast, unchanging void.
There's nothing else like it.
It goes on forever and never stops,
and everything else came from it.

I don't know what else to call it 
so I'll call it Tao.
What's it like?
I can tell you this much: it's great.

So great that it endures.
Something that endures 
goes a long way.
And something that goes a long way 
always comes back to the beginning.

Tao's great.
Heaven's great.
Earth's great. 
And someone in touch with Tao
is great, too.
Those are the four greatest things
in the universe.
 
Someone who's in touch with Tao 
is in touch with the earth.
The earth is in touch with heaven.
Heaven's in touch with Tao.
Tao's in touch with the way things are.
