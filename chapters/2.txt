3.

If you toss compliments around freely,
people will waste your time 
trying to impress you.
If you give things too much value,
you're going to get ripped off.
If you try to please people,
you'll just make them pissed.

The Master leads
by clearing the crap 
out of people's heads
and opening their hearts.
He lowers their aspirations
and makes them suck in their guts.

He shows you how to forget 
what you know and what you want,
so nobody can push you around.
If you think you've got the answers, 
he'll mess with your head.

Stop doing stuff all the time, 
and watch what happens.
