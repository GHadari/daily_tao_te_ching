37.

Tao never does anything 
but nothing is left undone.

If our leaders 
could get in touch with Tao,
the world would take care of itself.
Even if they wanted 
to impose their own ideas,
they'd be drawn back to Tao's 
nameless simplicity.

When our lives are that simple, 
we want for nothing.
We can relax, 
and the world becomes a better place.
