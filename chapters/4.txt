Tao's neutral:
it doesn't worry about good or evil.
The Masters are neutral:
they treat everyone the same.

Lao Tzu said Tao is like a bellows:
It's empty, 
but it could help set the world on fire.
If you keep using Tao, it works better.
If you keep talking about it, 
it won't make any sense.

Be cool.
