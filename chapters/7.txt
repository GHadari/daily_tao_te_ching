"Doing the right thing" is like water.
It's good for all living things,and flows without thinking about where it's going

...just like Tao.

Keep your feet on the ground.
Remember what's important.
Be there when people need you.
Say what you mean.
Be prepared for anything.
Do whatever you can, 
whenever it needs doing.

If you don't 
compare yourself to others,
nobody can compare to you.
