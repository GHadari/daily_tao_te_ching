With enough practice,
you could come and go without a trace,
speak without stumbling over words,
do complicated math problems 
in your head.

You could build a door with no lock 
that nobody could open.
You could tie something down 
with no knots, 
without even a rope,
and nobody could pry it loose.

Masters have time to help everybody, 
and ignore nobody.
They use their resources wisely, 
wasting nothing.
Some people call this 
"following the light."

Good people teach others 
because they have the potential 
to be good too.
Brains count for nothing
if you fail to respect your teachers
or to honor the potential in others.
That's one of the most important lessons of Tao.
