32.

Tao is an eternal mystery,
so small you can never take hold of it.

If a leader gets right with Tao,
people will follow him on instinct.
All will be right with the world.
People will do the right thing 
without being told.

Everything that comes from Tao 
needs a name.
But once everything has its name, 
you should make no other distinction between things.
This prevents you
from becoming trapped by them.

Everything in the universe is full of Tao 
and leads to Tao,
just like the water in rivers 
that flows into oceans.
