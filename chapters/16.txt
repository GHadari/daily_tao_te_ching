17.

When a Master takes charge,
hardly anybody notices.
The next best leader 
is obeyed out of love.
After that, 
there's the leader obeyed out of fear.
The worst leader is one who is hated.

Trust and respect people.
That's how you earn 
their trust and respect.

The Masters don't give orders;
they work with everybody else.
When the job's done,
people are amazed 
at what they accomplished.
