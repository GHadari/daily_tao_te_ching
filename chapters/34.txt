35.

When you get right with Tao, 
everybody wants to be your friend.
When they're around you, 
they can relax and enjoy themselves.

People can be easily distracted 
by music or good food.
When we try to talk about Tao, 
it seems boring by comparison.

It doesn't look like much.
It doesn't sound like much.
But no matter how much you use, 
there's still plenty left.
