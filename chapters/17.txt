When people lose touch with Tao,
they start talking about 
"righteousness" and "sanctity."

When people forget what's true,
they start talking about 
"self-evident truths."

When people have no respect
for one another,
they start talking about 
"political correctness" 
and "family values."

When the nation is unstable,
people start talking about "patriotism."
