31.

Weapons are terrible things.
If you want to get right with Tao,
reject weapons.

The Master, 
knowing all things came from Tao,
recognizes what he has in common 
with his enemies
and always tries to avoid conflict.

But when there is no other choice,
he uses force reluctantly.
He does so with great restraint,
and never celebrates a victory;
to do so would be to rejoice in killing.
A person who would rejoice in killing
has completely lost touch with Tao.

When you win a war, 
you preside over a funeral.
Pay your respects to the dead.
